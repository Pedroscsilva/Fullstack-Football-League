This is a fullstack project in which I created an API to serve a frontend application.

In this project I had the chance to develop E2E tests, an authentication method with JWT and a way to interact with the SQL database with sequelize.

## Executing it

Provided you have Docker and docker-compose installed on your machine, you may follow the commands below in your terminal to see the application working:

```bash
$ npm i
$ npm run compose:up
```

You can see the application work on localhost:3000 (if you aren't already using that port).

Also, you can see the API working. You should be able to access it with routes like localhost:3001/teams or localhost:3001/matches. You can also check ./app/backend/src/api/routes to see all available routes of the API.
